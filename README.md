# Smart-Heart-Beat-Monitoring-Using-Arduino

# INTRODUCTION
A cardio project is to make a heartbeat monitoring system using ardunio and pulse sensor and draw the graph of bpm using processing 3.3.7 <br/> 
# PROBLEM STATEMENT <br/> 
•	More than two million people are at the high risk of heart attack. <br/> 
•	It would be better for them monitor their heart rate easily by using pulse sensor. <br/> 
•	So in our project we focus on this problem and try to seek its solution. <br/> 
# ANALYSIS AND APPROACH <br/> 
•	Simple functionalities of ardunio. <br/> 
•	Serial monitor to check BPM <br/> 
•	Cardio graph using processing <br/> 
•	Serial plotter to observe graph <br/> 
# Requirements  <br/> 
Language : C Programming  <br/> 
Hardware : Arduino UNO, Pulse Sensor <br/> 
Software : Aruino IDE, Processing IDE for Graphics <br/>
